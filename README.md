# Description:
A console-based Banking Management System built using C++ and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. 
This project demonstrates efficient account management using concepts like inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and file handling.
# Features:
* Add New Account : Create Savings or Current accounts with unique features like interest rates and overdraft limits.
* Display Account Details : View detailed account information using polymorphic behavior based on account type.
* Deposit & Withdraw Funds : Perform transactions with real-time balance updates and proper validation (e.g., overdraft handling, insufficient balance check).
* File-Based Storage : Persist account data securely in structured text files to ensure retrieval, modification, and updates across sessions.
# OOP Concepts Used :
* Encapsulation: Bundled data and related functions inside classes.
* Inheritance: Base class Account extended by SavingsAccount and CurrentAccount.
* Polymorphism: Achieved through virtual functions to handle account-specific behaviors.
* Abstraction: Hidden internal implementation details from the user.
